# Project Name: Redux User Filter

## Description

- I have taken the liberty of making a home page for the website.
- The website has responsive design to fit desktop and mobile.
- To access the User Analyzer page you can go to the navigation bar and select User Activity.
- After you fill up the required inputs and press the generate button the page will redirect to the user list page, where you will see a list of users filtered by your given input, if there is any of course.
- You can also search for a user by their name from that list.
- And if you want to change your filter input, you can also press the Edit Filter button and change your filter input and press generate again to generate new list of users.
- I have completed the website with React.Js, Material UI, Bootstrap, React Hook Form and Font Awesome.
- Please make sure you install the node module after you download and unzip the file.
